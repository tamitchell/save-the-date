### Setup
This application runs on node v10.10.0

First clone or download this file to get started, once downloaded run an `npm install` to setup `node_modules/`.

#### Firebase Setup

You will need to ask the administrator for permssion to get started with firebase. Once added, they will send you a config file that you will need to define in a new .env file in your projectâ€™s root folder. The .env file can also be added to your .gitginore file (in case you are using git), so your Firebase credentials are not exposed publicly on a platform like GitHub.
